<html><body><span style="background-color: #ffc900;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9400;">These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. </span><span style="background-color: #ffab00;">Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition, and machine vision. </span><span style="background-color: #ffab00;">AI is a multidisciplinary field that includes computer science, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, operations research, economics, and mathematics. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9400;">AI research is divided into subfields that focus on specific problems, approaches, applications, and theoretical differences. </span><span style="background-color: #ffd500;">The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. </span><span style="background-color: #ff8800;">General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9a00;">Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9f00;">Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. </span><span style="background-color: #ffab00;">The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9f00;">The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." </span><span style="background-color: #ffb100;">This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues that have been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. </span><span style="background-color: #ffb700;">Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. </span><span style="background-color: #ff8e00;">Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. </span><span style="background-color: #ff8200;">Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning. </span><span style="background-color: #ff6400;">Other popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection, business process automation (BPA), and predictive maintenance. </span><span style="background-color: #ffb700;">Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and operational business patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. </span><span style="background-color: #ffb700;">Many of todayâ€™s leading companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. </span><span style="background-color: #ff8800;">Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies. </span><span style="background-color: #ffc900;">Like artificial intelligence, machine learning includes a variety of subtopics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. </span><span style="background-color: #ff9400;">Each type of machine learning algorithm differs in how they work and what kind of data they require. </span></body></html>
